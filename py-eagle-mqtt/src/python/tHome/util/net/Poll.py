class Poll:
   """: Posix poll manager.

   This classes manages the polling behavior for normal posix (non-gui)
   network code.  See the Python select module or UNIX poll
   documentation for details.

   Server and Link objects are added to the Poll and it will manage
   the I/O calls for each of them.  Instead of having a poll() method
   like the Python module, this class has a select() method to kee the
   API identical to the mpy.net.Select class.
